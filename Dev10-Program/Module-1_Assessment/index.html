<section class="main"> 
  <p>  I can confidently say that I've above average life and career experience.  I've  lived a  few countries and learned new  languages.  After college,  I worked for a  financial institution where I leaned about investment and retirement savings. As a recent college graduate at the time, I also realized that accounts with  millions are not only in movies.  For the last eight years I worked in public service witnessing the flip side of life. There are people who live in chronic poverty even  in the most developed place in the world.  </p>
      <p> In the last year and half I came to realize IT is a very valuable skill to have.  So between full time job and other life commitments  like watching funny cat videos, I invested a respectable amount of time, money, and energy preparing myself for a new , hopefully ,and mostly likely  final career.  I am looking forward to  hands on  and real world experience to become a skilled software developer.
