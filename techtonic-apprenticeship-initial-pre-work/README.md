### Introduction to Basic HTML and HTML5
**Say Hello to HTML Elements**
- Your answer goes here if you struggled with this lesson

Class modules to complete in freeCodeCamp:

# 1.   Introduction to Basic HTML and HTML5 (27 activities)
  
- In this section I did not have much struggle as I am familiar with most HTML concepts 


# 2. Introduction to Basic CSS (44 activities)
  
   - Clockwise Notation was a bit tricky to adding padding starting from   top to the left side . i had play around with it to identify the notation

   - Trying to figure out Hex Code worka bit difficult, but some more    information on line and youtube i was able to get a better grasp 

  - Creating custom CSS was something new and very useful future 

 # 3. Introduction to the CSS Flexbox Challenges (17 activities)

  - css flex Properties  were new styling concepts I wasn't familiar with but it's very useful and easy to learn. 
   
 # 4. Introduction to the CSS Grid Challenges (22 activities)
  - had to watch a tutorials on the minmax FunctionPassed activity to understand how to  place
       "repeat" and " minmax" codes together  properly . i had a little bit issue placing some of the  syntax in the right order like 
       like auto, repeat aut0-fill, auto-fit etc 


 # 5.  Introduction to JavaScript (107 activities) 
 
  -    Escape Sequences in Strings it was bit tricky to figure out if 
     \n or \b get you a new line 

- Quoting Strings with Single QuotesPassed
goodStr = 'Jake asks Finn, "Hey, let\'s go on an adventure?"'; 
badStr = 'Finn responds, "Let's go!"'; // Throws an error
the excercise asks to remove all \ from 
'<a href="http://www.example.com" target="_blank">Link</a>';
it's confusing why we'd remove \ in the url while we kept in the string variable ? 

-  Manipulate Arrays with...
    - .push() adds the last  element of an array
    - .pop() removes the last  element of an arrary 
    - .shift() removes the first element of an array
    - .unshift() adds     the first element of an array 
      
-   .unshift() is unclear 1. do we have to use myArray.shift();
             first and next .unshift()? 
             does it remove the 1st element and replaces it with the new ? or does it just add the new element
              without touch the exisiting elements ? 

- Shopping List was a little bit challenging trying to figure out to structure the sub-arrays with strings and numbers
 

 - adding  the data in an array is with the .pop() function.
           i.e var threeArr = [1, 4, 6]; 
         var twoArr = threeArr.pop() console.log(twoArr); // result [1,4]

-  in the multi-demensional arrays,  figuring out how to get a single element from an array was challenging although i understood the concept & structure  how arrary and nested arrary are excuted 

- Manipulating Complex Objects Passed
          I kept getting this one error message repeatedly
         "myMusic[1] should contain an artist property which is a string"
          which i did have string in the nested array "format" , I spent sometime debugging and found out it was spelling error. 

         note: The parseInt() function parses a string and returns an integer.

 - Recursion  is a difficult concept to understand, i'm going to watch some more tutorials  on youtube until i fully understand it 

# 6. Introduction to the ES6 Challenges (26 activities)
- "use strict"; is a new concept 
- 1 error message "The sum function should use the ... rest parameter on the args parameter." in the 
     "Rest Parameter with Function Parameters" acitvity was a bit challenging  
  - Spread Operator to Evaluate Arrays In-Place is a new js concept 
  -Destructuring Assignment to Assign Variables from Objects  is new concept 

  - "Use destructuring assignment within the argument to the function half to send only max and min inside the function." 
  this activity was a bit challeging but i got it resoved by rereading the question and checking the "help" 

  - Create Strings using Template Literals ${} `` is new and very useful syntax in place of other concatenation methods
  -  defining functions in objects using shorthand syntax is really cool,in way it removes a couple of steps
  - export default function from another file, what if there is more than one function in the file exported from ?
       * Note: 
  - JavaScript Promise : use it to make a promise to do something, usually asynchronously. When the task completes,
       - Promise is a constructor function, so you need to use the new keyword to create one. 
       - takes a function, as its argument, with two parameters - resolve (when you want your promise to succeed) and reject(when you want it to fail) syntax: const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {...});
       - has three states: pending, fulfilled, and rejected 
       - The then method is executed immediately after your promise is fulfilled with resolve. 
             syntax:  myPromise.then(result => {console.log(result)});
       - catch is the method used when your promise has been rejected. syntax:  myPromise.catch(error => {console.log(err)});
